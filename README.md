## 👋 Hi, I'm **PolyDevX**

I'm a 16-year-old developer who loves building random ideas and leveling up my coding skills one bug at a time.
I mainly work with **C#** and **Java**, but I’m always experimenting with new tools, frameworks, and weird dev ideas that pop into my brain at 2 AM.

### 🔧 What I Do

* Build small apps, tools, and experiments in **C#**
* Make Minecraft / game-related stuff in **Java**
* Learn new tech just by breaking everything first 💀
* Slowly turning into that one kid who codes everywhere — even in class (not proud, but also proud)

### 🎯 What I’m Working Toward

* Becoming a better full-stack/game dev
* Writing cleaner code instead of “it works so don’t touch it” energy
* Dropping more public projects instead of keeping them private forever

### 💬 Fun Facts

* Yes, I debug with print statements. No, I will not change.
* I refactor only when the pain becomes unbearable.
* I code like a caffeinated squirrel.

### ❓ Q&A

- **Q: Why “PolyDevX”?**  
A: Sounds cool, makes me look smarter than I actually am, and wasn’t taken 😭

- **Q: What languages do you use?**  
A: Mainly **C#** and **Java**, but I’ll touch anything that doesn’t explode instantly.

- **Q: How long have you been coding?**  
A: Long enough to know better, but not long enough to stop breaking everything.

- **Q: What kinda projects do you make?**  
A: Tools, small apps, Minecraft-related stuff, random experiments… basically whatever my brain cooks at 2AM.

- **Q: Are your repos clean?**  
A: Absolutely not. My code works, and that’s my only personality trait.

- **Q: Do you take suggestions or collabs?**  
A: Yeah, if it’s fun and doesn’t make me lose all my sanity.
